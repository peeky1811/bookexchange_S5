          BOOK EXCHANGE WEBSITE
    
This is a hassle-free website for junior and senior students in a college to exchange books online via this platform. No need to run around the college searching for prospective buyers and sellers that match your requirements. It's all here at the click of a button.

How to use?
Every user in a college has a unique registration number with which they sign up and log in. After logging in, you can search the available books for the book you require.
In the available books section, all details of the book are given like name, author, publication of the book and contact number of the person who is selling it. We can select the book we want then call the person and negotiate the price. 

More improvements to come.
